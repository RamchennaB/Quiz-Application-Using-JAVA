# Signature-Matching-using-Python

Signature Matching application offers a user-friendly solution for comparing two signatures. Developed using Python and libraries like OpenCV and scikit-image, the application allows users to upload or capture signature images. It computes the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) using the structural_similarity function from skimage.metrics, presenting the results in a clear interface. Users can easily compare the signatures visually, accompanied by a percentage match derived from the SSIM.
